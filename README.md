# matrixPortal-Binary-Clock

A clock that checks the internet for the time and displays it in binary format.
Add an LDR to turn the display on when the brightness in the room drops below a certain threshold.
Display won't flicker since the LDR values pass through hysteresis before making a decision on the state of the display.
